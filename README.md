# Boston-Housing-Model

For this project I work with a kaggle dataset for boston housing data.

The primary goal of this project is build a ML model that predicts the price of any home using other variables in the dataset. The target variable is 'medv' variable which represents 'median home value by $1000s.'
The secondary goal is to demonstrate my thought process when approaching data science problems.
